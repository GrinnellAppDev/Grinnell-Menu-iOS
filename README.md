###Other Info

The app will only allow you to select the dates on which a menu is available on the servers. These dates are updated (usually after classes on Friday) to show you the next week's selection. On our settings page, you will have access to filters you can use depending on your dietary preferences. You can also view nutritional information for certain dishes.
