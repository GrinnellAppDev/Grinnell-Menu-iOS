Grinnell Menu

Grinnell Menu is a quick and easy way to view the Grinnell College Dinning
Dinning Services menu for today, tomorrow, or any day in the next week.  
Grinnell Menu lets you view details about each menu item including 
nutritional information and an image and description.  Further, you can 
filter choices by personal dietary concerns such as vegan, gluten free, or 
lactose intolerant.  Add items to your 'tray' and view a total nutritional
summary once you've selected everything you wish to eat for a given meal.

Grinnell Menu is currently in ALPHA.  This means the application is
in development and not yet fully functional.
